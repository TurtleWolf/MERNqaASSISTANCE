I'm  covering the questions in 1 section per each day.. All the questions about the database had responses, I'm making it a point to read through them each anyways.. just in case I have something to add and to gather a more comprehensive understanding of the course and particular student's progress through it. On that note, I'm also watching the new questions to field them at a customer service level. I may not always know the most technical aspects, but it helps to let them know they are not screaming into a void, and it helps me push my own understandinng of the subject.
