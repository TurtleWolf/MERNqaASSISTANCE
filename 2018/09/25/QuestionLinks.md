2 things I've noticed recurrent in the questions.
1. a few people have decided your demo database must not be available anymore
2. at least 2 have had to ask their friends to install redux dev tools, so they could see it on their mobile phone

and for your own consideration.. the students question your terminology here and appear to be correct..
1. [Initializing vs. Declaring](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/v4/questions/4630724 "I looked it up, you would appear to be correct,
Declaration is not to declare 'value' to a variable; it's to declare the type of the variable. Assignment is simply the storing of a value to a variable. Initialization is the assignment of a value to a variable at the time of declaration.")

**_9/11_**  
I'm  covering the questions 1 section per day.. All the questions about the database had responses, I'm making it a point to read through them each anyways.. just in case I have something to add and to gather a more comprehensive understanding of the course and particular student's progress through it. On that note, I'm also watching the new questions to field them at a customer service level. I may not always know the most technical aspects, but it helps to let them know they are not screaming into a void, and it helps me push my own understanding of the subject.

**_9/17_**  
after the first week, I've switched strategies.. Rather than reviewing MERN one section per a day, I've added Modern Javascript From the Beginning. I'm keeping an eye on new questions in both courses and updating older questions as I get to that section. I still intend to repeat the MERN course, but I had a gut feeling I'd be more useful to everyone involved this way.

Usually only 30-45 seconds, but it will appear as a blank page until then. If you still don't see anything after leaving your phone there for five minutes, You could make sure it's on the desktop fist at the same time.

1. [A Router may have only one child element](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/learn/v4/questions/5144254 "It looks like you are passing an <app/> into <Router></Router>, remember React can only render a single element which should contain the others, try passing in just the <Router />  in which case you would probably want to restructure where the Router is loading the app.. not necessarily in another file, but you'll still need to get it in there, it's just that you can't feed one nested in the other straight to the rendered().")

Actually, I've never had to write this function, you'll find tools that are set up to log for you.. Oh, you can also just try scrolling up. If you can't scroll up, there's always the possibility that it's stuck in an infinite loop and scrolling down faster than you can go up.. so that'd make it look like it's disappearing.")

I found Materialize just a couple months after getting use to the BootStrap 4 being updated from 3. I haven't wanted to go back.. It feels a bit more light weight and stream lined to me. Maybe I just like their visual effects. Technically, I think you can use both at the same  time and one shouldn't effect the other.

So now we don't pull them off anymore, we just use binoculars to see if anything is written on the tag, Barrel of letters, a barrel of numbers.. etc
So typeof is our binoculars, but when we zoom in on the yellow tag to see if it has anything written on it, we still see the yellow tag as an object.
