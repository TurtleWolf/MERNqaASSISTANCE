I'm  covering the questions 1 section per day.. All the questions about the database had responses, I'm making it a point to read through them each anyways.. just in case I have something to add and to gather a more comprehensive understanding of the course and particular student's progress through it. On that note, I'm also watching the new questions to field them at a customer service level. I may not always know the most technical aspects, but it helps to let them know they are not screaming into a void, and it helps me push my own understandinng of the subject.

1. [I'm done with deployment on Heroku, it works fine onm my laptop but when i use my Mobile device to access the same  URL i'm unable  to access. It gives a blank page.](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/learn/v4/questions/5125084 "If you are using the free service at Heroku, keep in mind the servers are not always live. If no one has been to the URL in 30 minutes it becomes dormant. The first visitor after this time has expired would need to wait for the server to spin up again. Usually only 30-45 seconds, but it will appear as a blank page until then. If you still don't see anything after leaving your phone there for five minutes, You could make sure it's on the desktop fist at the same time. I made the similar oversight when I tried to show a friend a week after completing it. I forgot about the time it takes the server to initialize")

1. [Is it necessary to use constructor()? I think it is not, since we're using ES6.](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/learn/v4/questions/5145304 "We're always free to experiment.. but don't get frustrated when your results may vary.

1. [A Router may have only one child element](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/learn/v4/questions/5144254 "It looks like you are passing an <app/> into <Router></Router>, remember React can only render a single element which should contain the others, try passing in just the <Router />  in which case you would probably want to restructure where the Router is loading the app.. not necessarily in another file, but you'll still need to get it in there, it's just that you can't feed one nested in the other straight to the rendered().")

It almost sounds like a scoping problem. Imagine loading an <iframe >containing a whole website inside of an image tag is what it sounds like you're describing? So you need to find where to narrow your scope to just get the image and not the whole page around it?")  

1. [2 errors cannot set http header after they are sent. post.user is undefined](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/learn/v4/questions/5155662 "I need a bit more to work from.. screenshots? Copy of 'your' code.. sometimes it's easy to overlook a typo. The error message is a good place to start, but debugging is a process, make sure to gather all the evidence. It's possible they are the same bug or one is causing the other.. or they could be completely coincidental. Make sure to look at all your tabs in postman.

1. [Can't we reuse create-profile component to edit ?](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/learn/v4/questions/5161036 "yes, they are very similar, you probably could get away with restructuring them into the same file.. but he seems to be separating the logic for a reason. I think mainly to check if it exists already? He stresses the biggest difference around a minute in, adding componentDidMount(); If anything you'd be better off using Edit for both and not calling the extra function when Creating.. but that probably wouldn't illustrate the separation of concerns as well and could make it more confusing for many.")

If you want to keep it, you'll need to write a function to log your output to a file. These are referred to as log files and are often analyzed for diagnosing bugs after a crash. Actually, I've never had to write this function, you'll find tools that are set up to log for you.. Oh, you can also just try scrolling up. If you can't scroll up, there's always the possibility that it's stuck in an infinite loop and scrolling down faster than you can go up.. so that'd make it look like it's disappearing.")
