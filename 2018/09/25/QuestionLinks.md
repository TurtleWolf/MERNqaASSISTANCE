Usually only 30-45 seconds, but it will appear as a blank page until then. If you still don't see anything after leaving your phone there for five minutes, You could make sure it's on the desktop fist at the same time. I made the similar oversight when I tried to show a friend a week after completing it. I forgot about the time it takes the server to initialize")
