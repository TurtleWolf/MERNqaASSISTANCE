### I covered 80 interactions during this 2 week period  
after the first week, I've switched strategies.. Rather than reviewing MERN one section per a day, I've added Modern Javascript From the Beginning. I'm keeping an eye on new questions in both courses and updating older questions as I get to that section. I still intend to repeat the MERN course, but I had a gut feeling I'd be more useful to everyone involved this way.  
I'm  covering the questions 1 section per day.. All the questions about the database had responses, I'm making it a point to read through them each anyways.. just in case I have something to add and to gather a more comprehensive understanding of the course and particular student's progress through it. On that note, I'm also watching the new questions to field them at a customer service level. I may not always know the most technical aspects, but it helps to let them know they are not screaming into a void, and it helps me push my own understanding of the subject.  
fyi my paypal is different
