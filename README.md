Some questions are really just commentary, but by replying I've been able to reduce outstanding questions from **238 to 219** so far. I'm not including these in the ones I keep track of, it doesn't seem fair to milk you for minor commentary. But by replying to them it keeps the back log of questions easier to filter down to which ones don't have a response yet. My hope is to clear all of them in a sweep as I make my way forward reviewing each section. So if they are still outstanding at the end, they are more serious questions that are still over my head.
