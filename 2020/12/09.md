### December 2020

1. [How to provide chrome dev tools in vscode editor](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757064#questions/12383664 'introducing-chrome-debugger-for-vs-code on the right side of vscode you should have an icon for the extensions marketplace where you can search for chrome dev tools, you may also want to look at Debugger for Chrome with a lot more downloads and a four-star rating..')

1. [It seems like it won’t let me use the 3 extensions on Visual Studio Project](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757130#questions/12801477 "Did you figure this out.. I'm trying to clear up lingering questions.. but just saying it's not working isn't much to go on. What seems to be the difficulty? Is it giving you an error message? Can you post screen shots of where you are getting stuck at?")

1. [Is Val a keyword? Or could we use any other word in that place.](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757184#questions/13082046 "val is not a keyword, with a few minor exceptions (that he covered a few videos earlier) you can name your variables almost anything you'd like. The reason he keeps overwriting to val is so that he doesn't have to keep editing the console.log(val); at the bottom of the script")

1. [Hi, I've been coding along with the video but wondered if there is also the code which Brad is writing for the basic syntax available somewhere? I could only find the projects on Github, cheers Andrew.](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757194#questions/10781866 "Yes, AndrewIf you look under the tab for Course Content, each video has a resource on the right, clicking on this will download a zip file which you can extract by right-clicking after you've downloaded it locally and telling it where to extract the contents to. When I start a new section I go ahead and download all of them and then extract them into a shared folder.")

1. [there should be more explanation about compare function](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757204#questions/13100452 "learning to research a topic in order to expand your understanding could very well be the most valuable skill a developer could learn. Spending minutes in a search engine is minimal.. as you get into more complex programming you'll encounter bugs that take hours or even days, so getting a feeling for that now is a blessing in disguise.. even if you don't recognize it yet. But if there is something that is not clicking for you, pretend you are playing Jeopardy and try to word it as a question. I've found that often defining the question points me to the answer. Trying to clarify where I'm stuck causes the answer to reveal itself. and if you do find a useful link feel free to post it here for the rest of us to review")

1. [Trying to work out where I'm going wrong with the loan calculator. I've checked my HTML and Javascript code twice. When I put in the numbers, the console just displays the error message for a millisecond "Uncaught Referenceerror. Monthly is not defined at HTMLFormElement.calculateResults (apps.js.23). Here's the html and Javascript code:](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757266#questions/13314308 "the top of your javascript starts off quite a bit different than what Brad has in his repo.. https://github.com/bradtraversy/modern_js_udemy_projects/blob/master/loancalculator/app.js your first line after submit, goes to calculateResults.. where he has function(e). I'd also pay attention to what the error says Uncaught Referenceerror. Monthly is not defined at HTMLFormElement.calculateResults (apps.js.23) . that means start looking at line 23 in your app.js file, I assume it's a spacing issue, when I copy it to my editor it's on line 22, but when I save it with prettier it puts spaces around your asterisks. so it may just have trouble calculating what you are trying to set monthly to also, it'd help us to stay organized if you asked your question in the Q&A per that lecture instead of randomly at the end of another thread, it's only luck that I happened to notice it down here.")

1. [Why does nth-child selector start at 1, not 0? What's the reason to do this instead of starting at 0 like some other languages? (sorry for the noob question)](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757268#questions/12803317 "https://stackexchange.com//why-does-nth-child-in-css-start-from-1-instead-of-0/ I didn't read the whole thread, but with over 9,000 views on StackExchange, I'd say it's not a stupid question to be curious about. personally, I liked the last paragraph of the first answer..'While most programmers will be familiar with both 1 and 0-based indexing, normal people will naturally count from 1, and CSS is a language designed not just for programmers but for designers and graphic professionals, so it is natural to choose 1-based indexing.'")

1. [How exactly does this truly exemplify ES6.](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762276#questions/13304574 "At lecture 55, you are still aren't halfway through the course, Section 10, Lecture 88 ramps up to more of the ES5 features. Several beginners already feel overwhelmed, showing them arrow functions too early could be even more confusing, taking a short cut sooner than they understand the long way around, they wouldn't be ready to grasp what the shortcut is doing for them.")

1. [something wrong with Store() class/ getBooks() or addBook(). Nothing is being added to my local storage](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762276#questions/13342454 "I used the compare function in VSCode hoping it might highlight discrepancies between your file and Brad's. I thought it might narrow it down to a few lines to focus on.. Before I even got that far, I had to save a copy of your code and prettier added a few semi-colons near the end. Then I noticed you are using functions, which don't have all the superpowers included with classes. But most importantly is that you skip his section for local storage, which is what you said you were focused on.")

1. [How are id's for Microposts created?](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762278#questions/13327150/ "stackoverflow json-server-strange-autoincrement-id
1 It looks like the json-server does take care of incrementing automatically
2 Could you get a screenshot of the error? I'm not sure if you mean you deleted the whole field or just the value of that field. It checks the value of each property. If you deleted the field itself and not just the value of that field it wouldn't have anything to check and that undoubtly would throw an error.")

1. [Why the CLEAR TASKS button is a link? Line 35 index.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762202#questions/13346716 "Technically you could change it to a div and it'd still work the same. I think in some ways it's just tradition. If he didn't use the event listeners you'd still need a way to trigger the action of clearing, links have been a common way to do that in the past. Making it a div doesn't give any distinction or clarity, since divs are the most common html element, making it a link instead gives some cue that it'll trigger an action, even though he's doing that with the event listener now, it still indicates with semantics that element is going to be 'linked' to some action. You could also make it a span or just as an experiment try changing it to button or even monika or anything.. as long as it has a name that gives you a hint as to what it's going to do for you. But a link is another form of event listener that the browser knows to listen for by default, so I've seen other projects uses the links as a trigger to fire an action in the java-script. ")

## [Node.js API Masterclass With Express & MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/ 'Node.js API Masterclass With Express & MongoDB')

### December 2020

1. [It is not clear to me what is the advantage of using pm2 instead of npm start. Could somebody please discuss this?](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-api-masterclass/learn/lecture/16582202#questions/12843349 "The advantages of a process manager would be automation. If your server happens to crash while you're asleep it'd still be down when you wake up and you might still not be aware of it and then you'd need to log in and relaunch it manually. More recently I've moved this to DockerFiles that you can set to always restart or restart except when shutdown etc. But the difference between PM2 and npm start is that it can take care of itself automatically and you don't have to be there to babysit the server all day.")

1. [Production Mode](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-api-masterclass/learn/lecture/16582202#questions/12729972 "It looks like PM2 defaults to development To generate a sample process file I'd type this command: pm2 ecosystem This will generate a sample ecosystem.config.js")
