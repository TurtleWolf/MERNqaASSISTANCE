### December 2020

1. [How to provide chrome dev tools in vscode editor](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757064#questions/12383664 'introducing-chrome-debugger-for-vs-code on the right side of vscode you should have an icon for the extensions marketplace where you can search for chrome dev tools, you may also want to look at Debugger for Chrome with a lot more downloads and a four-star rating..')

1. [It seems like it won’t let me use the 3 extensions on Visual Studio Project](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757130#questions/12801477 "Did you figure this out.. I'm trying to clear up lingering questions.. but just saying it's not working isn't much to go on. What seems to be the difficulty? Is it giving you an error message? Can you post screen shots of where you are getting stuck at?")

1. [Is Val a keyword? Or could we use any other word in that place.](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757184#questions/13082046 "val is not a keyword, with a few minor exceptions (that he covered a few videos earlier) you can name your variables almost anything you'd like. The reason he keeps overwriting to val is so that he doesn't have to keep editing the console.log(val); at the bottom of the script")

1. [Hi, I've been coding along with the video but wondered if there is also the code which Brad is writing for the basic syntax available somewhere? I could only find the projects on Github, cheers Andrew.](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757194#questions/10781866 "Yes, AndrewIf you look under the tab for Course Content, each video has a resource on the right, clicking on this will download a zip file which you can extract by right-clicking after you've downloaded it locally and telling it where to extract the contents to. When I start a new section I go ahead and download all of them and then extract them into a shared folder.")

1. [there should be more explanation about compare function](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757204#questions/13100452 "learning to research a topic in order to expand your understanding could very well be the most valuable skill a developer could learn. Spending minutes in a search engine is minimal.. as you get into more complex programming you'll encounter bugs that take hours or even days, so getting a feeling for that now is a blessing in disguise.. even if you don't recognize it yet. But if there is something that is not clicking for you, pretend you are playing Jeopardy and try to word it as a question. I've found that often defining the question points me to the answer. Trying to clarify where I'm stuck causes the answer to reveal itself. and if you do find a useful link feel free to post it here for the rest of us to review")

1. [Trying to work out where I'm going wrong with the loan calculator. I've checked my HTML and Javascript code twice. When I put in the numbers, the console just displays the error message for a millisecond "Uncaught Referenceerror. Monthly is not defined at HTMLFormElement.calculateResults (apps.js.23). Here's the html and Javascript code:](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757266#questions/13314308 "the top of your javascript starts off quite a bit different than what Brad has in his repo.. https://github.com/bradtraversy/modern_js_udemy_projects/blob/master/loancalculator/app.js your first line after submit, goes to calculateResults.. where he has function(e). I'd also pay attention to what the error says Uncaught Referenceerror. Monthly is not defined at HTMLFormElement.calculateResults (apps.js.23) . that means start looking at line 23 in your app.js file, I assume it's a spacing issue, when I copy it to my editor it's on line 22, but when I save it with prettier it puts spaces around your asterisks. so it may just have trouble calculating what you are trying to set monthly to also, it'd help us to stay organized if you asked your question in the Q&A per that lecture instead of randomly at the end of another thread, it's only luck that I happened to notice it down here.")

1. [Why does nth-child selector start at 1, not 0? What's the reason to do this instead of starting at 0 like some other languages? (sorry for the noob question)](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757268#questions/12803317 "https://stackexchange.com//why-does-nth-child-in-css-start-from-1-instead-of-0/ I didn't read the whole thread, but with over 9,000 views on StackExchange, I'd say it's not a stupid question to be curious about. personally, I liked the last paragraph of the first answer..'While most programmers will be familiar with both 1 and 0-based indexing, normal people will naturally count from 1, and CSS is a language designed not just for programmers but for designers and graphic professionals, so it is natural to choose 1-based indexing.'")

1. [How exactly does this truly exemplify ES6.](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762276#questions/13304574 "At lecture 55, you are still aren't halfway through the course, Section 10, Lecture 88 ramps up to more of the ES5 features. Several beginners already feel overwhelmed, showing them arrow functions too early could be even more confusing, taking a short cut sooner than they understand the long way around, they wouldn't be ready to grasp what the shortcut is doing for them.")

1. [something wrong with Store() class/ getBooks() or addBook(). Nothing is being added to my local storage](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762276#questions/13342454 "I used the compare function in VSCode hoping it might highlight discrepancies between your file and Brad's. I thought it might narrow it down to a few lines to focus on.. Before I even got that far, I had to save a copy of your code and prettier added a few semi-colons near the end. Then I noticed you are using functions, which don't have all the superpowers included with classes. But most importantly is that you skip his section for local storage, which is what you said you were focused on.")

1. [How are id's for Microposts created?](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762278#questions/13327150/ "stackoverflow json-server-strange-autoincrement-id
1 It looks like the json-server does take care of incrementing automatically
2 Could you get a screenshot of the error? I'm not sure if you mean you deleted the whole field or just the value of that field. It checks the value of each property. If you deleted the field itself and not just the value of that field it wouldn't have anything to check and that undoubtly would throw an error.")

1. [Why the CLEAR TASKS button is a link? Line 35 index.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762202#questions/13346716 "Technically you could change it to a div and it'd still work the same. I think in some ways it's just tradition. If he didn't use the event listeners you'd still need a way to trigger the action of clearing, links have been a common way to do that in the past. Making it a div doesn't give any distinction or clarity, since divs are the most common html element, making it a link instead gives some cue that it'll trigger an action, even though he's doing that with the event listener now, it still indicates with semantics that element is going to be 'linked' to some action. You could also make it a span or just as an experiment try changing it to button or even monika or anything.. as long as it has a name that gives you a hint as to what it's going to do for you. But a link is another form of event listener that the browser knows to listen for by default, so I've seen other projects uses the links as a trigger to fire an action in the java-script. ")

1. [What about the i class "fa fa-remove" is not the children of?](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757276#questions/11778354 "If I understand your question..I went back to lecture 26 where he mentions children of children, but just getting the grandchild didn't seem to be enough. I kept getting undefined. Eventfully I tried adding the zero index and finally that narrowed it down to fa & fa-remove.")

1. [I was wondering why I don't see things like e.target.innerText in the intellisense when typing? Is there a plugin I'm missing?](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757278#questions/10847670 "are you not getting any suggestions on your intelliSense at all, or just not as many as you'd like. I don't see e.target.innerText on mine or Brad's either for that matter.. but I do get addEventListen, id and several others. The documentation says it should be included out of the box for JavaScript and that if it's not working it literally says to just try turning it off and back on again. So maybe on your next reboot it's picking it up now? https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense#_why-am-i-not-getting-any-suggestions")

1. [In event does it trigger all the events of parent ,whether they are same to the child event or not? like in the example shown they had the same event of "click".](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757286#questions/11212575 "the short answer is it only triggers the same event, I did some experimenting, but it was hard to find another event that would allow me to click, but not have a mouse down, a mouse up, or no other type of movement that wouldn't also be triggered by a parallel event. But to clarify, it triggers any and only ancestors listening to that same event, I copied in the other events from 2 lectures previously to have them handy as a reference to find other events for experimenting with.// EVENT BUBBLING
document.querySelector('.card-title').addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log('card title 1st bubble');
});
document.querySelector('.card-content').addEventListener('dblclick', function () {
  console.log('card content dblclick no bubble here');
});
document.querySelector('.card').addEventListener('dblclick', function () {
  console.log('card mousedown no bubble here');
});
document.querySelector('.col').addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log('click after skipping parent and granparent triggers great granparent');
});
// Click
// clearBtn.addEventListener('click', runEvent);
// Doubleclick
// clearBtn.addEventListener('dblclick', runEvent);
// Mousedown
// clearBtn.addEventListener('mousedown', runEvent);
// Mouseup
// clearBtn.addEventListener('mouseup', runEvent);
// Mouseenter
// card.addEventListener('mouseenter', runEvent);
// Mouseleave
// card.addEventListener('mouseleave', runEvent);
// Mouseover
// card.addEventListener('mouseover', runEvent);
// Mouseout
// card.addEventListener('mouseout', runEvent);
// Mousemove
// card.addEventListener('mousemove', runEvent);")

1. [What's the need for not putting event under the body? Since the events will delegate, what's the difference between putting it under the ul and body?](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757286#questions/5896120 "at 6:52 he says you could put it on anything.. (which he probably means any ancestor in the lineage) you can kind of hear him thinking out loud at that point, but he thought the body would be a more robust example of the issue. As an experiment, you should be able to change body to ul and everything else should still work the same.oops, my experiment failed, and it may be another reason he focused on the body.. just changing body to ul wasn't enough, I kept getting ul is not defined, so I had to make sure I isolated it first with a querySelector, but then it worked as expected.
    // document.body.addEventListener('click', deleteItem);
    // document.ul.addEventListener('click', deleteItem);
    let ruizUL = document.querySelector('ul');
    ruizUL.addEventListener('click', deleteItem);
    function deleteItem(e) {
      if (e.target.parentElement.classList.contains('delete-item')) {
        console.log('delete item');
        e.target.parentElement.parentElement.remove();
      }
    }
")

1. [COOKIES PLEASE Hey could you make an addition to this for cookies, perhaps include the path from a marketing campaign to persisting ad info to cookies and such. Thanks. Love what you have offered so far.](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757290#questions/3782208 "I searched his YouTube channel for cookies and I'm surprised I didn't find more on them.. he touches on them periodically, but generally in the context of another subject.
Node.js API Authentication With JWT
I do feel like I got a lot from his API course.. he goes into using Postman and makes extensive use of cookies in that course.
Udemy Course Alert - Node.js API Masterclass
specifically, he mentions cookies in 8 different lectures, 48, 49 & 50 are probably what I'm remembering..")

1. [Fa-remove icon isn't showing up
   For some reason, the remove icon isn't showing up on the right side. Here's the screenshot and my code. What am I missing?](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8762202#questions/13372176 "comparing your code to his, the differences are minor, except for double or single quotes, but it does look like you've tried to update your external scripts tags. I'd start by pinning to the exact numbers he's referenced, just to make sure and then if you still wanted to update you'd know you're on the right track. But what your asking about is a font awesome icon and you are loading it from a different source. His link to font-awesome has bootstrap in the href and yours has pro
and are you on the edge browser? he has one line near the top of his HTML that you don't have at all
and cdns like to stay in the cache, so you might want to make sure that's cleared out for a refresh")

   How can I stop from registering the same book twice. The "isbn" is always unique . and get an alert the book is already exist. any tips](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/lecture/8757290#questions/13369738 "That is definitely possible, but you'll have to think through the extra steps of complexity. You'll probably want something like a for loop to go through the array of isbn numbers to see if it's already in there and then you could call that from the validation check as an if-else statement, after the if and before the else that are already in it. If you are still stuck in a couple of days I'll see if I can code it this weekend.")

1. [It is not clear to me what is the advantage of using pm2 instead of npm start. Could somebody please discuss this?](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-api-masterclass/learn/lecture/16582202#questions/12843349 "The advantages of a process manager would be automation. If your server happens to crash while you're asleep it'd still be down when you wake up and you might still not be aware of it and then you'd need to log in and relaunch it manually. More recently I've moved this to DockerFiles that you can set to always restart or restart except when shutdown etc. But the difference between PM2 and npm start is that it can take care of itself automatically and you don't have to be there to babysit the server all day.")

1. [Docker, microservices and kubernetes
   This was the type of course I was looking for and I learned a lot. Thank you very much.
   I was wondering if you plan on taking this course a step further and may be break it up in to microservices using docker, and kubernetes and deploy it on the cloud. If so, that would be awesome and I would help me a great deal and I am sure others can benefit as well.](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-api-masterclass/learn/lecture/16581866#questions/13342794 "Exploring Docker [1] - Getting StartedExploring Docker [2] - Docker Compose With Node & MongoDBI think he mentions Brett Fisher who also has a great youtube channel and several good Udemy courses, one of which is very specific about Node apps in Dockerfiles. I've completed it, but there are about 3 or 4 key points I need to review and make notes on. Like how he switches to the Node User and why he prefers Slim over Alpine or vice versa.. a snippet he uses for closing the server process.. and how he recommends catching the std out. Oh, and why it's better to start the server with node instead of npm (extra process starting another process causes another issue)There's actually some very specific criticism he has of the standard example. after I finish the review and update my notes I'll be sure to post a copy of my compose file back here with a link to the repo.Search his channel for Node, he probably recaps most of it in each of these videos.")
